About:
The MR-Automatic Network Arranger (MiRANA) is a utility used to produce re-arrangable and customisable network visualisations for MR estimates.

Instructions:
1) First obtain new MR estimates using the MR Base estimate utility (requires R) OR populate a CSV file yourself (ensure the format is the same, see included CSV for reference)
2) Run the visualisation web file, follow instructions and upload your data
3) Arrange nodes in the graph as desired and screen shot the graph (e.g., by pressing PrtScn and pasting into paint or using the Snipping Tool utility which comes with Windows, or by pressing CMD + shift + 4 to screen grab on Apple OS)
